# WiseBot
 A Discord Bot that uses the GPT-3.5 LLM, the discord.py API Wrapper, and the OpenAI API! Add it to your Discord Server so users can ask their burning questions to this bot!

 If you want to use this code in the already existing code of one of your bots, go ahead! Just make sure to credit the repository. That would be much appreciated!

 **Setup Guide**

 1. Create a Discord bot profile on the Discord Website! Follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtXXoMxaho
 2. Note down the bot's token somewhere, and make sure that the bot is given the permissions listed here:

 3. Create your OpenAI account if you don't have one already, and generate an API Token. You can also follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafDyRsVnXU
 4. Make sure to note this API Key down somewhere as well! My advice is to make a .txt file or a document on your computer with the Discord Bot Token and the OpenAI   Key.
 5. Download the code!
 6. Open the .env file, and paste in your newly generated Discord Bot Token and OpenAI API Key where the file instructs you.
 7. Run the main.py file, and you're done!
