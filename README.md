# WiseBot
 A Discord Bot that uses the GPT-3.5 LLM, the discord.py API Wrapper, and the OpenAI API! Add it to your Discord Server so users can ask their burning questions to this bot!

 It's super simple and really easy to implement into whatever you want.

 If you want to implement this into something, by all means, go ahead! Please make sure to credit this repository if you do so. That would be much appreciated!

 **Setup Guide**

 1. Create a Discord bot profile on the Discord Website! Follow this tutorial [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtXXoMxaho)
 2. Note down the bot's token somewhere, and make sure that the bot is given the permissions listed here:

 3. Create your OpenAI account if you don't have one already, and generate an API Token. You can also follow the tutorial [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafDyRsVnXU) Also, please note that using the API costs money! At the time of writing, you get $5 to use in the first 3 months after activation of your account. If you wish to use more than this, you must link a payment method.
 4. Make sure to note this API Key down somewhere as well! I advise making a .txt file or a document on your computer with the Discord Bot Token and the OpenAI Key.
 5. Download the code!
 6. Now, you'll have to install the ```requirements.txt``` file. To do this, you'll have to locate the path of the folder with the source code in it. Then, you'll have to open a Terminal/Command Prompt window and go into the folder. You can do this by running the command ```cd <path to folder>```. If you are in Visual Studio Code, you can just hit the icon to open a terminal in the top right, and you will automatically be inside the folder. Then, run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. After you run this, all the required pip modules will be downloaded!
 7. Open the .env file, and paste in your newly generated Discord Bot Token and OpenAI API Key where the file instructs you. Make sure to save the file with Ctrl + S or âŒ˜ + S
 8. While inside the folder in your terminal (```cd <path to folder>```), run the main.py file using the command ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py``` if that command doesn't work. Also, you can just hit the play button in many code editors such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
 9. You're done! Enjoy using the bot!
